My entry is located in the folder Liberty-Entry. 

I first played around with the static image and found a way to flip or mirror the words on the liberty advert. This code is located in the Liberty_Mirror file and the screenshot of this can be found in the screenshots folder labelled 'Liberty Mirror Screenshot'

Then I started to play about with moving the image and the idea of a sliding puzzle came to mind. So I sliced the image into tiles and made these move around before forming the actual picture. You have to click on the image to get it to move around and then click on it again to form the final Liberty Find Yourself image. This code is locaed in the Liberty_Tile.pde file and the screenshots for this can be found in the screenshots folder.
