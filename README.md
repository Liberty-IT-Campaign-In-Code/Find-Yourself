# Find-Yourself
This year our graduate recruitment campaign has been built using code. 

Now we want to see what you can do with what we've made. 

Have a play and then post your entries here before **Wednesday 9th October** to be in with a chance to win an **Amazon Show**.

# How to take part
To enter you can create a branch and submit your entry.

You can use the code to make an imaginative reworking of the campaign creative, ensuring it resolves to the Find yourself artwork (6-sheet-blank.jpg) or (336x280-static.jpg)

It would also be great if you could post the running code below your outcome of the code so it can be displayed on the digital AdShel screens (6-sheets) and display adverts (336x280). Bringing your code to life!

# Software sketchbook
Weâ€™ve used the open-source graphical library Processing for this project.

You can download Processing here - https://www.processing.org/download/.
