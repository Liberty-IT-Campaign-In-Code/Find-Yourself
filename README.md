# Find-Yourself
This year our graduate recruitment campaign has been built using code. 

Now we want to see what you can do with what we've made. 

Have a play and then post your entries here before **Wednesday 9th October** to be in with a chance to win an **Amazon Show**.

# Software sketchbook
Weâ€™ve used the open-source graphical library Processing for this project.

You can download Processing here - https://www.processing.org/download/.
